## üìù Implementation Updates (July 16, 2025) - **PENDING FINAL TEST/CONFIRMATION**

### Google Sheets Structure Changes:
1. **Extended columns from Y to Z** (now 26 columns total: A-Z)
2. **Two-column CDG tracking approach**:
   - Column Y: "CDG SMS Sent" - Shows "YES" when SMS is sent
   - Column Z: "CDG Enrollment Status" - Shows "PENDING" ‚Üí "ENROLLED"/"DECLINED"

### Code Changes Made:
- Updated `google_sheets_service.py`:
  - Headers array extended to include both CDG columns
  - All ranges updated from A:Y to A:Z
  - `log_sms_sent()` now updates both columns Y and Z
  - `log_sms_response()` only updates column Z
  - valueInputOption remains 'RAW' for proper data insertion
- Updated `app.py`:
  - Sheet data array extended to include two CDG columns
  - Regex pattern already correct for Z column
  - Columns U-X show full Google Drive URLs (no hyperlink formulas)

### Latest Fix (Hyperlink Issue):
- **Problem**: HYPERLINK formulas were showing "View Bill", "View POA" etc. instead of actual URLs
- **Solution**: Reverted back to inserting plain Google Drive URLs
- **Also Fixed**: Changed valueInputOption back to 'RAW' to prevent data interpretation issues

### Testing Required:
- Verify columns Y and Z appear in Google Sheets
- Confirm SMS sent updates column Y to "YES" and column Z to "PENDING"
- Confirm SMS response updates column Z to enrollment status
- Verify full Google Drive URLs appear in columns U-X (not hyperlink formulas)

## üîß Critical Webhook Fix (July 16, 2025) - **PENDING FINAL TEST/CONFIRMATION**

### Issue Discovered:
- CDG enrollment status stuck on "PENDING" after customer replies "Y"
- Twilio logs showed "no HTTP requests logged for this event"
- Direct curl testing returned 403 Forbidden error
- Root cause: HTTPS/HTTP mismatch due to Render.com reverse proxy

### Solution Implemented:

#### 1. **X-Forwarded-Proto Fix**:
When deployed on Render.com, the application runs behind a reverse proxy. Twilio signs webhooks with the public HTTPS URL, but Flask sees HTTP internally, causing signature validation to fail.

**Fix applied in `/sms-webhook` route:**
```python
# Fix HTTPS/HTTP mismatch when behind Render's proxy
proto = request.headers.get('X-Forwarded-Proto', 'http')
if proto == 'https' and request_url.startswith('http://'):
    request_url = request_url.replace('http://', 'https://', 1)
```

#### 2. **Phone Number Normalization** (Next Step):
Need to normalize phone numbers for matching in Google Sheets:
```python
def _normalize_phone(self, phone):
    """Extract last 10 digits for US phone comparison"""
    return ''.join(filter(str.isdigit, str(phone)))[-10:]
```

#### 3. **Debug Mode Added**:
New environment variable `TWILIO_WEBHOOK_DEBUG` allows bypassing signature validation for testing:
- Set to "true" in Render.com for debugging
- **IMPORTANT**: Must be removed or set to "false" in production

### Enhanced Logging Added:
- üîî Webhook hit logging (shows incoming requests)
- üîß URL fix logging (shows HTTPS correction)
- üì® Parameter logging (shows From number and Body)

### Testing Options:

#### Option 1: Test Webhook Endpoint (Recommended)
1. Deploy changes to Render.com
2. Navigate to: `https://greenwatt.gtbsolarexchange.com/test-sms-webhook`
3. Enter the phone number from the submitted form
4. Select "Y" and submit
5. Check logs and Google Sheets for updates

#### Option 2: Real SMS Testing
1. Deploy these changes to Render.com
2. Set `TWILIO_WEBHOOK_DEBUG=true` temporarily in Render environment variables
3. Send a test SMS reply
4. Verify webhook receives and processes the response
5. Check that CDG Enrollment Status updates from "PENDING" to "ENROLLED"
6. **IMPORTANT**: Remove debug flag after confirming it works

### Important Notes:
- This is a common issue with applications deployed behind reverse proxies
- The fix ensures Twilio's signature validation works correctly
- Phone number normalization is still needed for proper row matching

### ‚ö†Ô∏è PRODUCTION CHECKLIST:
1. **Remove or set `TWILIO_WEBHOOK_DEBUG=false`** in Render.com environment variables
2. **Test webhook endpoint** (`/test-sms-webhook`) is safe to keep as it doesn't bypass security
3. **Your existing enrollment**: No action needed - your "ENROLLED" status in Google Sheets won't cause issues
