# OCR Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The OCR is failing in production because:
1. The `pdf2image` Python package was already in requirements.txt but wasn't being imported properly
2. The `poppler-utils` system package (required by pdf2image) wasn't being installed in the build process

## What's Happening
- Google Vision API is configured correctly (service account is working)
- OpenAI API key is configured correctly  
- But the PDF-to-image conversion is failing with: "No module named 'pdf2image'"
- This causes Vision API to receive empty content and return 0 characters

## Fixes Applied
1. **Confirmed pdf2image is in requirements.txt**
   ```
   pdf2image==1.16.3
   ```

2. **Added requests to requirements.txt** (was missing)
   ```
   requests==2.32.3
   ```

3. **Updated render.yaml to install poppler-utils**
   ```yaml
   buildCommand: "apt-get update && apt-get install -y poppler-utils && pip install -r requirements.txt"
   ```

4. **Enhanced error logging in app.py**
   - Added detailed traceback logging for OCR failures
   - Added debug information about file existence and API key configuration

5. **Added multiple verification endpoints**
   - `/verify-config` - Check production configuration
   - `/health` - Health check with dependency verification
   - `/test-ocr-simple` - Test OCR functionality directly

6. **Created documentation**
   - `SYSTEM_DEPENDENCIES.md` - Documents system package requirements
   - `validate_requirements.py` - Script to validate Python imports vs requirements.txt
   - Updated `CLAUDE.md` with system dependency information

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push these changes
2. Render will automatically redeploy
3. The build process will now:
   - Install poppler-utils system package
   - Install pdf2image Python package
   - Enable proper PDF processing for OCR

## Verification After Deployment
1. Visit `/health` to check all dependencies are installed
2. Visit `/verify-config` to check API keys are configured
3. Submit a test form with a utility bill
4. Check if service address, POID, account number, and usage are populated in Google Sheets
5. If issues persist, visit `/test-ocr-simple` to test OCR directly

## Prevention Measures Added
- Requirements validation script to catch missing packages
- System dependencies documentation
- Health check endpoint for monitoring
- Enhanced error logging for better debugging
