### Google Sheets SMS Tracking
The system uses a simplified single-column approach for tracking CDG enrollment:

- **CDG Enrollment Status** (Column Y): Tracks the complete enrollment journey
  - PENDING - SMS sent, awaiting response
  - ENROLLED - Customer replied Y/YES
  - DECLINED - Customer replied N/NO
  - INVALID: [response] - Unrecognized response

Phone numbers are matched using the existing Column G data, eliminating duplication and simplifying the tracking process.
