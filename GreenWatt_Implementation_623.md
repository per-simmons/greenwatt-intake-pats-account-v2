# GreenWatt Implementation - June 23, 2025

## Client Feedback Summary
1. OCR data appears to be overridden by form fields for POID and Service Address
2. Commercial agreements need Exhibit 1 populated (second to last page)
3. Need to add document preview links to Terms & Conditions checkbox
4. Specific bill not working: `utility_bill_20250619_193755.pdf`

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: OCR Testing and Analysis ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Test OCR with problematic bill (utility_bill_20250619_193755.pdf)
- [x] Test OCR with all sample bills in folder
- [x] Document OCR extraction success rates
- [x] Identify patterns in OCR failures

**OCR Test Results:**
```
Bill: utility_bill_20250619_193755.pdf (NYSEG bill)
- POID Extracted: ✅ YES - "N01000000093617" (labeled as POD ID)
- Service Address Extracted: ✅ YES - "195 MAIN ST, ONEONTA NY 13820"
- Account Number Extracted: ✅ YES - "1004-3067-502"
- Notes: OCR is working correctly! The issue is that PDFs use form data instead of OCR data.
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The issue is NOT with OCR extraction, but with how the data is used in PDF generation:

1. **Current behavior in app.py (process_submission_background):**
   - Line 1205: `form_data.get('poid', '')` → Uses FORM data for POID
   - Line 1199: `form_data['service_addresses']` → Uses FORM data for Service Address

2. **This explains why:**
   - OCR might extract data correctly
   - Both form and OCR data are saved to Google Sheets
   - But PDFs always use the form data, ignoring OCR results

3. **The fix is simple:**
   - Change these lines to use `ocr_data` instead of `form_data`
   - Remove the form fields entirely to prevent confusion

### Phase 2: Google Sheets and Form Restructuring ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Backup current Google Sheets structure
- [x] Update column headers in google_sheets_service.py
  - [x] Remove 'Service Address' (Column I)
  - [x] Remove 'POID (Form)' (Column O)
  - [x] Rename 'POID (OCR)' to 'POID'
  - [x] Rename 'Service Address (OCR)' to 'Service Address'
- [x] Update data logging in app.py
- [x] Remove form fields from index.html
- [x] Update JavaScript validation

**Column Mapping Changes:**
```
OLD STRUCTURE:
- Column I: Service Address (Form) → REMOVE
- Column O: POID (Form) → REMOVE
- Column P: POID (OCR) → RENAME to "POID"
- Column U: Service Address (OCR) → MOVE to Column I

NEW STRUCTURE:
- Column I: Service Address (from OCR)
- Column O: POID (from OCR)
- Columns shift left by 2 positions
```

### Phase 3: Exhibit 1 Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Analyze commercial agreement PDFs for Exhibit 1 structure
- [x] Add EXHIBIT_1_ANCHORS to anchor_mappings.py
- [x] Update anchor_pdf_processor.py for Exhibit 1 population
- [x] Test with all commercial agreement types:
  - [x] Meadow-NYSEG-Commercial-UCB-Agreement.pdf
  - [x] Meadow-National-Grid-Commercial-UCB-Agreement.pdf
  - [x] Meadow-RGE-Commercial-UCB-Agreement.pdf

**Exhibit 1 Field Mapping:**
```
PDF Field → Data Source:
- Utility Company → ocr_data['utility_name']
- Name on Utility Account → form_data['account_name']
- Utility Account Number → ocr_data['account_number']
- Service Address → ocr_data['service_address']
```

### Phase 4: Document Preview Links ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create static document serving routes
- [x] Update Terms & Conditions checkbox with links
- [x] Add CSS styling for document links
- [x] Test document preview functionality

**Documents to Link:**
1. POA: `GreenWattUSA_Limited_Power_of_Attorney.pdf`
2. Agency Agreement: `GreenWATT-USA-Inc-Communtiy-Solar-Agency-Agreement.pdf` (note typo in filename)

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] OCR reliability testing
- [x] Google Sheets data logging verification
- [x] Exhibit 1 population testing
- [x] Document preview testing
- [x] End-to-end submission testing
- [x] Email/SMS notification testing

## Issues and Resolutions

### Issue 1: OCR Data Override
**Problem:** Form fields override OCR-extracted data
**Solution:** Remove form fields for POID and Service Address, rely solely on OCR

### Issue 2: Missing Exhibit 1
**Problem:** Commercial agreements have unpopulated Exhibit 1 table
**Solution:** Add anchor mappings and implement table population

### Issue 3: No Document Preview
**Problem:** Users can't preview documents before agreeing
**Solution:** Add static document routes and preview links

## Code Changes Log

### Files Modified:
1. `services/google_sheets_service.py` - Column restructuring
2. `app.py` - Data logging updates, new routes
3. `templates/index.html` - Form field removal, preview links
4. `static/js/main.js` - Validation logic removal
5. `services/anchor_mappings.py` - Exhibit 1 anchors
6. `services/anchor_pdf_processor.py` - Exhibit 1 processing
7. `static/css/style.css` - Document link styling

## Testing Results

### OCR Testing Summary:
- Total bills tested: 5+ sample bills
- POID extraction success rate: 100% (for NYSEG/RG&E bills that have POID)
- Service Address extraction success rate: 100%
- Account Number extraction success rate: 100%

### Exhibit 1 Testing:
- NYSEG Commercial: ✅ PASSED - All fields populated correctly
- National Grid Commercial: ✅ PASSED - All fields populated correctly
- RG&E Commercial: ✅ PASSED - All fields populated correctly
- Positioning adjusted: dy=25 (moved up 5px from original)

### End-to-End Testing:
- Form submission: ✅ WORKING
- PDF generation: ✅ WORKING (POA + Agreement + Agency Agreement)
- Google Sheets logging: ✅ WORKING (24 columns, A-X)
- Email notifications: ✅ WORKING (SendGrid with EST timestamps)
- SMS notifications: ✅ WORKING (Twilio integration complete)

## Notes
- Agency Agreement filename has typo: "Communtiy" instead of "Community"
- Keep form field processing in backend for 30-day transition period
- OCR fallback strategy: If OCR fails, log error but continue processing
- Consider adding manual override option for failed OCR in future update

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Complete OCR testing with problematic bill - DONE
2. ✅ Implement Google Sheets restructuring based on test results - DONE
3. ✅ Add Exhibit 1 support for commercial agreements - DONE
4. ✅ Deploy and monitor for issues - READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

## Summary of Completed Work (June 23, 2025)
1. **OCR Fix**: Updated app.py to use OCR data instead of form data for POID and Service Address
2. **Form Cleanup**: Removed POID and Service Address fields from the form entirely
3. **Google Sheets**: Updated to 24 columns (A-X), removed duplicate form/OCR columns
4. **Exhibit 1**: Successfully implemented for all commercial agreements with proper positioning
5. **Document Preview**: Added routes and links for POA and Agency Agreement preview
6. **Testing**: All components tested and verified working correctly

## Deployment Ready
All client feedback has been addressed and tested. The system is ready for production deployment.
