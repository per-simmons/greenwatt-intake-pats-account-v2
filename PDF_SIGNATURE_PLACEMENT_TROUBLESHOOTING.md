# PDF Signature Placement Troubleshooting Guide

## 🎯 Goal
Implement a pixel-perfect signature placement system for GreenWatt PDF documents that:
- Finds specific text anchors ("By:", "Name:", "Title:") in PDF templates
- Places customer signatures and information at the exact coordinates
- Works consistently across different PDF templates (POA, Agreements)
- Handles multi-page documents with signatures on different pages

## ✅ Problems Resolved

### 1. **Signature Page Placement** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Signatures appearing on page 2 instead of page 9
- **Root Cause**: PDF overlay creation bug - wrong page indexing in ReportLab canvas
- **Solution**: Fixed overlay creation to generate correct number of pages (0-8) and place content on proper page
- **Result**: Signatures now correctly appear on page 9 under "SUBSCRIBER:" section

### 2. **Anchor Detection** ✅ WORKING  
- **Issue**: System not finding "By:", "Name:", "Title:" anchors correctly
- **Root Cause**: Google Sheets environment variables missing, causing fallback to legacy generator
- **Solution**: Set GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID and GOOGLE_AGENT_SHEETS_ID environment variables
- **Result**: Anchor detection working perfectly - finds text on any page dynamically

### 3. **Context-Aware Search** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Issue**: Multiple "By:" matches causing wrong section selection
- **Solution**: Added context validation to ensure matches are on same page as "SUBSCRIBER:"
- **Enhancement**: Added preference system to select "second" match for subscriber vs producer sections
- **Result**: Correctly places signatures in subscriber section, not producer section

### 4. **Email Field Removal** ✅ COMPLETED
- **Issue**: Email appearing randomly on page 7
- **Solution**: Commented out email field from anchor mappings
- **Result**: No more unwanted email placement

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

Based on research and code review:

1. **Anchor text might not match exactly** - PDFs can store text with hidden characters, different encoding, or as part of larger text blocks
2. **Page numbering mismatch** - PDF uses 0-based indexing, but visual page numbers might differ
3. **Coordinate system issues** - When anchors aren't found, system may default to incorrect coordinates
4. **Search area too restrictive** - Current 200-point search box might miss the actual fields

## 📋 Solution Plan (Step-by-Step)

### Phase 1: Debugging & Discovery
1. **Create debug script** to dump all text from target pages
   - Extract ALL text with coordinates from pages 7-9
   - Save to text file for analysis
   - Identify exact text format of anchors

2. **Verify page numbers**
   - Confirm page 9 (visual) = page 8 (0-indexed)
   - Check if PDF has cover pages affecting numbering

3. **Test anchor detection in isolation**
   - Create simple test to find "SUBSCRIBER:" 
   - Log all matches with coordinates
   - Verify search is looking at correct page

### Phase 2: Improve Search Algorithm
1. **Use pdfplumber's `search()` method**
   ```python
   # Instead of manual word iteration
   matches = page.search("By:")
   ```

2. **Implement fuzzy matching**
   - Handle variations like "By :", "By:", "BY:"
   - Account for extra spaces or formatting

3. **Expand context search**
   - Look for fields to the RIGHT of labels, not just below
   - Increase search radius
   - Try searching entire page if context fails

### Phase 3: Alternative Approaches
1. **Visual landmark detection**
   - Look for underlines or form field boxes
   - Use relative positioning from page margins

2. **Template-specific coordinates**
   - If anchor detection continues to fail
   - Map exact coordinates for each template
   - Less flexible but more reliable

3. **Hybrid approach**
   - Try anchor detection first
   - Fall back to template-specific coordinates
   - Log which method was used

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

1. **Create test harness** with known good PDFs
2. **Log extensive debug information**
3. **Visual verification** - Generate PDFs with visible markers showing where system is searching
4. **Incremental testing** - Fix one issue at a time

## ⚠️ Contingency Plan

If after thorough testing (estimated 5-10 iterations) the pdfplumber approach continues to fail:

### Alternative Solutions to Consider:
1. **PyMuPDF (fitz)** - Different PDF library with potentially better text extraction
2. **Adobe PDF Services API** - Commercial solution with robust form filling
3. **Pre-mapped coordinates** - Less dynamic but guaranteed to work
4. **Fillable PDF forms** - Convert templates to have actual form fields

### Decision Criteria:
- If anchor detection fails >80% of the time after fixes
- If implementation time exceeds 2 more days
- If edge cases make the solution unreliable

  - Customer Signature, Printed Name, Date, Email Address all populated
  - Unique POA ID: `POA-20250617152111-7f7424`

### 🔧 POA Anchor Mapping Fix Applied:
**Root Cause**: POA_ANCHORS were searching for partial text instead of full labels
- ❌ Was searching for: `"Signature:"`, `"Name:"`, `"Email"`
- ✅ Fixed to search for: `"Customer Signature:"`, `"Printed Name:"`, `"Email Address:"`
- ✅ Adjusted dx offsets to properly reach signature lines after labels

### 🔧 Critical JSON Data Handling Bug Fix Applied:
**Root Cause**: Test endpoints expecting FORM data but receiving JSON data
- ❌ **Agreement Test Endpoint**: Using `request.form.get('title', 'Manager')` defaulting to "Manager"
- ❌ **POA Test Endpoint**: Using `request.form.get('contact_name')` returning `None` (blank signatures)  
- ❌ **Data Mismatch**: Sending JSON via curl but endpoints reading form data
- ✅ **Fixed Both Endpoints**: Changed from `request.form.get()` to `request.get_json()`
- ✅ **Result**: Proper data flow - "Sarah Wilson" signatures, "President" title, correct email

### System Capabilities Confirmed:

### Ready for Production Deployment! 🚀

## 🆕 PHASE 3: POA PAGE 1 FIELD POPULATION

### 📋 Analysis: POA Customer Information Fields (Page 1)

**Current Status**: POA Page 1 "Customer Information" section is blank and needs population:
- ❌ **Customer Name:** ________________ (should be filled)
- ❌ **Service Address:** ________________ (should be filled)  
- ❌ **Utility Provider:** ________________ (should be filled)
- ❌ **Utility Account Number:** ________________ (should be filled)

### 1. **Data Availability Assessment** ✅ CONFIRMED

**Form Data Available:**
- ✅ **Customer Name**: `form_data['account_name']` or `form_data['contact_name']`
- ✅ **Service Address**: `form_data['service_addresses']` (textarea field in main form)
- ✅ **Utility Provider**: `form_data['utility_provider']` (dropdown selection)
- ✅ **Utility Account Number**: `ocr_data['account_number']` (extracted from utility bill)

### 2. **Implementation Approach** 📋

**Step 1: Add POA Page 1 Anchors to `POA_ANCHORS` dictionary:**
```python
# Additional POA Page 1 Customer Information Fields
"customer_name_page1": {
    "anchor": "Customer Name:",
    "dx": 150,  # Offset to reach input line
    "dy": -2
},
"service_address_page1": {
    "anchor": "Service Address:",
    "dx": 160,
    "dy": -2
},
"utility_provider_page1": {
    "anchor": "Utility Provider:",
    "dx": 170,
    "dy": -2
},
"utility_account_page1": {
    "anchor": "Utility Account Number:",
    "dx": 220,
    "dy": -2
}
```

**Step 2: Update Field Mapping Logic in `anchor_pdf_processor.py`:**
```python
elif field_name == "customer_name_page1":
    text_value = form_data.get('account_name', '')  # Primary account name
elif field_name == "service_address_page1":
    text_value = form_data.get('service_addresses', '')
elif field_name == "utility_provider_page1":
    text_value = form_data.get('utility_provider', '')
elif field_name == "utility_account_page1":
    text_value = ocr_data.get('account_number', '')  # From OCR extraction
```

**Step 3: Test Anchor Detection:**
- Use debug script to find exact coordinates for Page 1 anchors
- Verify text placement doesn't overlap with existing content
- Adjust dx/dy offsets for proper alignment

**Step 4: Integration Testing:**
- Test POA generation with both Page 1 and Page 2 field population
- Verify all customer information flows correctly from form → POA
- Confirm OCR account number extraction works properly

### 3. **Benefits of This Enhancement** 🎯

- ✅ **Complete POA Automation**: No manual data entry required
- ✅ **Consistent Data Flow**: Same form data populates both Agreement and POA
- ✅ **OCR Integration**: Account numbers automatically extracted from utility bills
- ✅ **Professional Output**: Fully populated POA documents ready for customer signing

### 4. **Priority Level**: **Medium** (Enhancement)
- **Current System**: Fully functional for signatures (Page 2)
