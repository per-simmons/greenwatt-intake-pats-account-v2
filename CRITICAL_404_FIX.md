# CRITICAL 404 FIX - Missing Progress Route

**Date**: 2025-06-27  
**Issue**: Progress endpoint returns 404 for ALL requests  
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Breaks all form submissions  
**Root Cause**: The `/progress/<session_id>` route is **COMPLETELY MISSING** from app.py  

## üö® THE ACTUAL PROBLEM

After extensive investigation, the 404 errors are NOT caused by memory cleanup or session deletion. The progress endpoint **doesn't exist at all** in the Flask application!

### Evidence:
1. `get_progress()` function exists in app.py (line 238)
2. BUT it has NO `@app.route` decorator
3. Therefore, Flask never registers the endpoint
4. ALL requests to `/progress/<session_id>` return 404 because the route doesn't exist

### Why Previous Fixes Failed:
- Emergency fix protected sessions from deletion ‚úì
- But sessions were never being deleted in the first place
- The endpoint to check them was missing entirely
- We were fixing the wrong problem!

## üîß THE FIX

### Step 1: Add the Missing Route (CRITICAL)
```python
@app.route('/progress/<session_id>')
def get_progress_route(session_id):
    """Get current progress for a session"""
    # Remove cleanup_old_sessions() call here to prevent race conditions
    
    if session_id not in progress_sessions:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Session not found'}), 404
    
    session = progress_sessions[session_id]
    
    # [Rest of the existing get_progress function code...]
    # Calculate remaining time, build response, etc.
    
    return jsonify(response_data)
```

### Step 2: Fix Race Condition
The current code calls `cleanup_old_sessions()` on EVERY progress check:
```python
def get_progress(session_id):
    """Get current progress for a session"""
    cleanup_old_sessions()  # <-- This is dangerous!
```

This creates a race condition where:
1. User submits form ‚Üí session created
2. Frontend polls `/progress/<id>` 
3. Progress endpoint calls cleanup
4. Cleanup might delete the session being checked
5. Result: 404 error

**Fix**: Remove the cleanup call from get_progress. Let only the background thread handle cleanup.

### Step 3: Improve Memory Management
Current cleanup at 300MB is still too aggressive:
```python
if memory_mb > 300:
    # Current code can still delete active sessions here
```

**Fix**: Even at critical memory levels, NEVER delete in-progress sessions:
```python
if memory_mb > 300:
    # Only clear completed sessions older than 5 minutes
    for session_id, session in list(progress_sessions.items()):
        if (session.get('status') == 'completed' and 
            time.time() - session.get('completed_time', 0) > 300):
            del progress_sessions[session_id]
```

## üìã Implementation Checklist

1. **Add the route decorator** to get_progress function
2. **Remove cleanup_old_sessions()** call from progress endpoint  
3. **Test locally** that `/progress/<any-id>` returns JSON (not 404)
4. **Deploy** the fix
5. **Monitor** logs to confirm no more 404s

## üß™ How to Test

1. Start the server locally
2. Create a test session:
   ```python
   # In Python console while app is running
   import requests
   import json
   
   # Submit a form (or use test endpoint)
   response = requests.post('http://localhost:5001/submit', ...)
   session_id = response.json()['session_id']
   
   # Check progress endpoint
   progress = requests.get(f'http://localhost:5001/progress/{session_id}')
   print(progress.status_code)  # Should be 200, not 404!
   ```

3. If you get 404, the route is still missing
4. If you get 200, the fix worked

## üéØ Why This Matters

- Without the progress route, NO form submissions can complete properly
- Frontend polls for progress but always gets 404
- Users see timeout errors even though processing may succeed
- This is why multiple agents couldn't fix it - they were looking at memory issues

## üìù Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify routes exist** before debugging endpoint issues
2. **404 errors mean "not found"** - check if the route is registered
3. **Don't assume complex causes** - sometimes it's a simple missing decorator
4. **Test endpoints directly** with curl/requests before investigating logic

## üöÄ Next Steps

After fixing the missing route:
1. Monitor for any remaining 404s
2. Verify form submissions complete without timeouts  
3. Check memory usage is still under control
4. Consider adding route listing endpoint for debugging

---

**For Next Agent**: The fix is simple - just add `@app.route('/progress/<session_id>')` above the get_progress function. Everything else is optimization.
